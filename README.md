# Silicon-Syndicates
Our project for Transfinitte Hackathon 

The main branch contains the backend part of out project ,i.e. implementaion of SQL using mariaDB. IT constanly monitors 4 .txt files for any changes and if it detects
any, then it pushes the changes to local SQL server.

The Proteus branch contains the simulation project file made with proteus 8.11 pro [NOTE: Prject file does not open in newer version of proteus. Only works with 8.11]
It also contains the exported flowchart and schematic capture from the project file.


How to use simulation:

1.There are 4 students with roll number 1111110001,1111110002,1111110003,1111110004.

2.An extra binary digit is added with the roll numbers to indicate whether a student is inside or outside the campus ,i.e. if its 0, he/she is inside and if its 1, 
he/she is outside.

3. IN button is pressed to mimic the scanning of rfid reader in real world. 

4. And enter the roll number into the virtual terminal in the format mentioned here : x111111000y where x->binary bit || y->roll number

5. press print button to check how many students are inside and outside the campus.

6. That's it!! Have a great day!
